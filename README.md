## Abstract  

The goals of this project were to:
  1. contribute code to a partially constructed object-oriented application
  2. follow spec/promts to make a working application
  3. implement ES6 classes
  4. write modular, resusable code that follows SRP
  5. implement a robust testing suite using TDD

The objectives were to write a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, get feedback, and see a final score at the end of the round.

2. **Clone down the forked repo**: From your GitHub profile repo, select the green `code` drop down and select `SSH` to copy the repo remote-address. If you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run:

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```
3. **Change into the repo directory**: Install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
4. **Run the root file to play the game**: Run `node index.js` from the root of your project, which should kick-off the game start in your terminal.
